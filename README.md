**Next Steps Considerations:**

*   **Update `Limitations.md`:** Ensure the limitations document also accurately reflects the v1.0.0 changes (statelessness, Firestore dependency, client responsibilities).
*   **Refine Production Readiness (Phase 3):** Add monitoring hooks (e.g., metrics for tool calls, job polling), health check endpoints, more robust input validation, and refine graceful shutdown.
*   **Testing:** Add integration tests specifically verifying the Firestore interaction for BQ jobs. Update existing tests to reflect mandatory arguments.
