# Sample environment variables for mcp.agent
# Rename this file to .env and fill in your actual values.
# IMPORTANT: Add .env to your .gitignore file to avoid committing secrets!

# --- MCP Agent Server Configuration ---

# [SSE Only] API Key for Client Authentication
# This key is REQUIRED by the server ONLY if it's started with the --require-api-key flag.
# Clients must then send the 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_KEY_HERE>' header.
# Generate a strong, random key for this value.
# MCP_AGENT_API_KEY=replace_with_your_strong_random_api_key

# --- Google Cloud Platform Configuration (Optional - ADC usually handles this) ---

# Optional: Specify the GCP Project ID.
# If not set, the google-cloud libraries will attempt to determine the project ID
# from the environment (e.g., gcloud config, GCE metadata server, GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT env var).
# GCLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id
# GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id # Alternative name recognized by some libs

# Optional: Point ADC to a specific Service Account Key file (JSON).
# This is an alternative to 'gcloud auth application-default login' or using
# credentials from the compute environment (like GCE metadata).
# The service account needs appropriate IAM roles for GCS and BigQuery.
# Ensure this JSON key file is kept secure and is not committed to version control.
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json

# --- Other Potential Configurations (Not currently implemented, but examples) ---
# LOG_LEVEL=INFO # Could be used to override default log level
# DEFAULT_GCS_CHUNK_SIZE=524288 # Could configure default chunk size
# DEFAULT_SIGNED_URL_EXPIRY=600 # Default expiry in seconds
