# Notes:
# - Specify exact versions if needed for strict reproducibility (e.g., ==2.5.0).
# - google-api-core and google-auth are typically installed as transitive dependencies
#   by the google-cloud-* libraries. No need to list them explicitly unless you
#   require a very specific version.
# - This file does not include testing dependencies (like pytest). Those are usually
#   managed separately (e.g., via pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies]
#   or a requirements-dev.txt).
